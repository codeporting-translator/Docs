## CodePorting.Translator Cs2Cpp download ##

You can always download the latest version of the translator from the CodePorting <a href="https://products.codeporting.com/translator/csharp-to-cpp/release">website</a>. The evaluation version of CodePorting.Translator Cs2Cpp (without a license specified) provides full product functionality, but it throws evaluation error message and stops the translating process when source C# project does not comply to evaluation limitations.
