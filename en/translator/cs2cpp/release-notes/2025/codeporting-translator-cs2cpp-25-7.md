## Major Features ##

None.

## Minor fixes ##

1. Implemented the Max property for SortedSet.
1. Fixed the behavior of ScopeGuard desctructor logic. Now safely handles exceptions during stack unwinding by wrapping the cleanup call into a try/catch block if an exception is active.
1. Implemented the method System::SharedPtr<RandomNumberGenerator> RandomNumberGenerator::Create().

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes ##

1. Removed Emscripten from the release bundle â€” builds for this platform are no longer included in the release.
