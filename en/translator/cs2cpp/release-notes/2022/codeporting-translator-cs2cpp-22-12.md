## Major Features ##

1. Static build of the library is now available.
1. Improved the usability of the Aspose.Slides for the C++ API.

## Minor Fixes ##

1. Fixed the `is_Authenticated` exception.
1. Excluded static fields from autogenerated `operator ==` in structs.
1. Refactored build configuration to reduce the number of linker warnings when building asposecpplib on macOS, thus significantly reducing the build log size.
1. Added more Cross Module Tests for RTTI.
1. Fixed the translation of the `is` operator for System.Enum.
