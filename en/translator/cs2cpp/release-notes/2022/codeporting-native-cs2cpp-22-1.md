## Major Features ##

1. The new implementation for System::Xml was provided. Previously, we had custom implementation which was based on the libxml2 and libxslt libraries. The new version is based on the ported CoreFX code.
1. The Readme files were added to the Nuget and downloadable packages.
1. The double-conversion library was upgraded to 3.1.7 version.
1. The `events_with_custom_accessors` node was supported in the porter configuration files. It makes it possible to inform the porter on custom events in non-ported code.

## Minor fixes ##

1. The compound assignment operators now work with the ported structures containing corresponding arithmetic operators.
1. The comparison operators for the structures that have `IsNull` method were fixed.
1. The `force_const_ref_parameters` option was imrpoved. If applied to the class constructor, it also affects generated member `MakeObject` function (if any), thus improving the performance of the ported code.
1. Unwanted dependencies were removed from `make_const_ref.h`.
1. This-comparison was optimized in the ported code. `SmartPtr` instance is no longer created.
1. The Qt conversion functions were updated at GitHub.
1. The shaping for symbolic fonts was disabled, like in .Net.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes ##

1. The implementation of `System::Xml` classes was completely reworked. Some APIs may have become unavailable. Some APIs may have changed. The new API is much closer to such of .Net. Please use the API reference for more information.
2. The supported glibc version will be changed in the upcoming releases.
3. The new `IEnumerable`-level iterators and iterators for collections with duck typing will be introduced in one of the upcoming releases. The code which is dependent on `EnumeratorBasedIterator` or `DuckTypedIterator` may require some changes.
4. Some declarations (e. g. `StreamPtr`) will be removed from the global namespace in the upcoming releases.
