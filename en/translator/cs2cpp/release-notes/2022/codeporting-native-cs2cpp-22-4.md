## Major Features ##

1. From the configuration file, the attributes can now be applied to static constructors and protected internal members.

## Minor fixes ##

1. The code generation was fixed in the porter for the case of assigning exception class field.
1. On MacOS, the BitMap class constructor no longer ignores the failure to allocate too large bitmap.
1. The `GetSharedMembers()` method is now const both in the library classes and in the generated code.
1. In some cases of translating delegates, the code generation was fixed to avoid missing the required forward declarations.
1. The `getInternalPtr()` method was supported by the `System::SmartPtr` class.
1. The porter was missing the global namespace references in the generated code for some cases of matching namespace names. This was fixed.
1. The `System::Drawing::GetThumbnailImage()` method was implemented.
1. The `RegionDataNodeRect` constructor was optimized.
1. The 1 bit per pixel black-and-white image loading was fixed.
1. The comparison of the infinite and empty regions was fixed.
1. The CppMemberwiseClone implementation was moved to the cpp files in the ported code.
1. The porting of the argumentless `Action` delegate was fixed.
