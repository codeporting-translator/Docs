## Major Features ##

1. The iterators provided by the IEnumerable class and the duck-typed collections were improved. The performance was raised for those implemented via the native C++ containers, and the assignment to the referenced element was supported where possible.
1. The new `build_cs_projects` option was supported by the porter.
1. The definitions of some attributes were fixed. The `AttributeUsage` mask was updated.
1. The method overloads were added to numerous classes. These support `ArrayView`-typed parameters where only `ArrayPtr` was supported previously.
1. The default messages of the exception classes were put in line with the .Net behavior. No language-specific messages are supported at the moment.

## Minor fixes ##

1. The new constructors of the `System::Drawing::FontFamily` class were supported.
1. The visibility of the nested private classes was fixed.
1. The RUNPATH entry was deleted from the Linux and MacOS dynamic libraries.
1. The new `collect_porter_coverage_info` option was supported by the porter. However, it is only available to Aspose users.
1. The RIPEMD-160 hash algorithm was supported by the library.
1. On MacOS, the RTTI information for the exception types was properly exported. Now the exceptions thrown by CodePorting.Native Cs2Cpp or dependent projects can be caught by the customer's code.
1. The size of the CodePorting.Native Cs2Cpp library was reduced on MacOS and Linux.
1. The `operator ==` declared in the `System` namespace was causing compilation issues with the third party code if exported to the global namespace. This was fixed.
1. The compilation issues were fixed for the case of the direct inclusion of some headers.
1. The `free` value of the `tests_garbage_collection` option is no longer supported by the porter.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes ##

1. The iterator types of `System::Collections::Generic::IEnumerable` and duck typed-collections were completely reworked. This may alter some code.
1. The supported glibc version will be changed in the upcoming releases.
1. The support of the `tests_garbage_collection` option was reduced. There are no possible usecases for the retired values anyway.
