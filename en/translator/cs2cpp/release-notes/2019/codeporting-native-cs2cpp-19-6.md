## Major Features ##

1. C++ [code injection](https://wiki.codeporting.com/native/cs2cpp/developer-guide/limitations-and-bugs/cpp-code-injection/)Â feature is added which allows injection C++ code through C# code comments.
1. Remaining warnings produced by library headers and ported code are fixed for clang and GCC compilers.
1. Legacy 'csPorter.Cpp.API' and 'CodePorting.Native.CsToCpp' Nuget packages are dropped. No new versions of these will be planned.

1. Floating point numbers rounding issues are fixed for some cases of values rendering.
1. Missing 'override' keywords are placed around in library headers.
1. CollectionAssert.AreEqual and CollectionAssert.AreNotEqual methods are suppported when porting NUnit tests.
1. 'gb2312' codepage decoding is fixed.
1. Issue is fixed with weak pointers' assignment operator if the object being assigned to it has same address that the previous (deleted) one had.
1. Translation of structure initialization with list of named expressions is fixed.
