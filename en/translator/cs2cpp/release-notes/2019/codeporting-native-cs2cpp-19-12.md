## Major Features ##

1. The Botan library used by the project was upgraded to 2.11.0.
1. ['rename_files' configuration node](https://wiki.codeporting.com/native/cs2cpp/developer-guide/codeporting-native-cs2cpp-configuration-file/configuration-file-nodes/#Hrename_files)Â was supported by the porter.
1. FileStream class was refactored with its behavior fixed closer to such in .Net. Related classes were also improved. Files locking now works better on Linux.
1. The Skia library used was upgraded and patched.
1. Support was added for more Aspose C++ products to be used in single customer applications.

## Minor fixes ##

1. Same XML loading options used for XmlFile, XmlStream and XmlTextReader.
1. Issues generating Doxygen comments for static initializers were fixed.
1. XmlTextReader::get_Name() method was fixed for some special cases ('#' prefix).
1. Includes generation was fixed for the cases when 'generate_includes_subdirectory' option is enabled.
1. FileStream constructor was fixed for specific combination of parameters (FileMode::OpenOrCreate and FileAccess::Write).
1. XmlTextWriter::get_BaseStream() returning nullptr was fixed if specific constructor was used.
1. Thread.Interrupt() was implemented for sleeping threads only.
1. Includes for cross-referencing headers were fixed for specific cases.
1. Porting of increments and decrements used on protected properties was fixed.
1. Missing include for NotImplementedException class was fixed in porter when generating stubs.
1. MeasureCharacterRanges() method was fixed for special characters.
1. An emSize/6 pixels shift used by .Net when rendering non-generic typographic text is reproduced by Graphics:: DrawString().
1. LineCap drawing was fixed for some specific cases.
1. SortedList implementation is now capable of storing structures.
1. Porter is now capable of tracking changes in documentation comments by processing the 'HashCode' tag. Warnings are generated for unexpected changes.
1. Exceptions thrown by Bitmap::LockBits in some cases were fixed.
1. Some performance issues within System::Drawing namespace was fixed.
1. GraphicsPath::get_PathTypes was fixed for some cases.
1. Error handling by XmlTextWriter::WriteProcessingInstruction() method was fixed.
1. Fixing ZlibBaseStream no longer closes on a closed inner stream.
