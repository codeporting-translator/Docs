## Major Features ##

1. Multiple fixes were applied to System::Drawing subsystem to make it behave more in line with .Net implementation.

1. CryptoStream::FlushFinalBlock() method has been added.
1. TryParse(String, TimeSpan&) and Duration() methods are supported by TimeSpan class.
1. Multiple changes to graphics subsystem may result in some images being rendered in a different way now.
1. EXTERNAL_REFCOUNT feature is now disabled in debug to make behavior consistent with release version.
1. StreamWriter::StreamWriter(const String&, bool, const EncodingPtr&, int) overload constructor was implemented.
1. System.Security.SecureString class was implemented.
1. HashSet::HashSet(SharedPtr<IEnumerable>) constructor was implemented.
1. XPathNavigator::SelectSingleNode(String, SharedPtr<XmlNamespaceManager>) was implemented.
1. Some stub classes and methods were added.
1. XmlDocument::get_DocumentType() method was implemented.
1. (((
The following syntax is no longer valid:
try
{
    Foo();
}
catch (const System::Exception &e)
{
    System::Console::WriteLine(e.get_Message());
}
Instead, use the following syntax:
try
{
  Foo();
}
catch (const System::Exception &e)
{
    System::Console::WriteLine(e->get_Message());
}
)))
