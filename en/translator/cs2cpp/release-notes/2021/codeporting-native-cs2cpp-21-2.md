## Major Features ##

1. Now the porter can prolong the captured variables’ lifetime. A runtime error doesn't occur any longer when the delegate leaves the original scope it was created in. The 'default_lambda_capture_mechanism' and 'avoid_lambda_holders_if_possible' porter options were added to control this behavior. For fine tuning, one may use the 'CppLambdaPassByReference', 'CppLambdaPassByValue', 'CppLambdaShouldCaptureByReference' and 'CppLambdaUseHolder' attributes.
1. The porter is now translating a code from the documentation comments so that the ported documentation has a C++ look rather than a C# one. This behavior can be controlled by the 'translate_code_from_comments' and 'translate_code_from_comments_system_dlls' porter options.
1. The documentation for the library code was extended and improved.
1. Debugging helpers for Qt Creator were added to the release package.

## Minor fixes ##

1. The PrintTo method instantiation was fixed for some cases.
1. The 'forwarding_if_possible' porter option was fixed.
1. Some unwanted macros were removed and/or replaced with their direct equivalents both in the library and in the ported code.
1. Some issues with includes and forward declarations in the ported code were fixed. This includes their instability, missing includes, ignoring the CppForceInclude and CppForceForwardDeclaration attributes.
1. In some contexts, the porter no longer ignores the actual value of the 'endl' option.
1. The FastRTTI mode now works properly when there are no instantiatable classes present in the hierarchy.
1. The Path::GetDirectoryName() function now normalizes the path, same as in .Net.
1. The exception throwing was put in line with .Net implementation when items are added into XmlNamespaceManager.
1. Creation of bold and italic glyphs for the incomplete fonts was fixed on Linux.
1. Some potential memory leaks and crashes were fixed in the Thread class.
1. Widths of some synthesized glyphs were fixed.
1. The exceptions throwing when adding items into XmlNamespaceManager were put in line with .Net implementation.
1. More cmake target scripts were added into the release package to make sure that the Ninja build system works properly with the MSVC libraries.
