## Major Features ##
1. API reference was improved for multiple classes. Usage examples were added. Some misprints were fixed.
2. Now the `CODEPORTING_CURRENT_RETTYPE` macro is used as the return type of the `get_Current` method. Now it's just a stub that do not modify its argument type, but in one of upcoming releases, it will return a reference instead of a shared pointer copy in the collections that store reference types or strings.
3. The generic 'foreach' enumeration translation rules is changed to:
{{< highlight cpp >}}
auto x_enumerator = y->GetEnumerator();
while (x_enumerator->MoveNext())
{
   auto&& x = x_enumerator->getCurrent();
   // ...
}
{{< / highlight >}}
4. Forward declarations are sorted in alphabetical order as much as it's possible without violating topological sorting.
5. Namespaces that contain forward declarations are opened and closed as rare as possible.
6. Now Skia is built without the OpenGL support.
7. Now the porter supports using of the `CppArgumentKind` attribute with an argument type name parameter.
8. Now the `CppArrayOnStack` attribute can be applied only to single-dimensional arrays.
9. Implemented text alignment when using `Graphics::DrawString` with a given rectangle.
10. The zeroing of matrix values is removed when the `Multiply` method is called.

## Minor fixes ##
1. `NullReferenceException` is thrown when sorting elements of the `List`- and `Array`-class instances that contain null elements. Fixed.
2. The `IPAddress`- and `IPEndPoint`-class static data initialization order is fixed.
3. Now `ArrayView` can be passed as an argument to the `Array.Copy` method.
4. `CheckedCast` doesn't throw `OverflowException` when the casted number is out of the value range. It also causes the compilation error (by warning C4018). Fixed.
5. The `Bitmap::set_Palette` method is optimized. It worked slowly with large images.
6. The new template was added for the case when the setter accepts `const PropT&` and the getter returns `PropT`. It happens when `force_const_ref_parameters = true`.
7. The delegate translation was improved.
8. The number of `GraphicsPath` points was fixed when the `AddString` method is used to add the tabulation symbol.
9. The `begin` and `end` methods were added to the `ArrayView` class.
10. Now the `StackArray`-class instance is used instead of `std::array` as a parameter in the `ArrayView` constructor.
11. Now the porter supports extension methods for the primitive types.
12. The `System.Drawing.Drawing2D.AdjustableArrowCap` class was implemented.
13. The `TextureBrush` constructor now behaves as in .Net.
14. The implicit `object.Equals(object, object)` method call is ported to `Equals(left, right)` instead of `System::Object::Equals(left, right)`.
15. The porter doesn't translate the `cref` tag when another project contains the specified type. Fixed.
16. The new `force_const_ref_return_type_simple_properties` option is added. Simple property getters (that contain only one return statement) of shared pointer types return const references to backed fields when this option is enabled.
17. Now the porter supports global enums with the `Flags` attribute.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes ##
1. The new implementation of the classes that belong to the 'System.Xml' namespace will be based on the ported code of CoreFx 2.0 instead of using libxml2. The classes that belong to the 'System.Xml.Serialization', 'System.Xml.Xsl.IlGen', 'System.Xml.Xsl.QIL', 'System.Xml.Xsl.Runtime', and 'System.Xml.Xsl.Xslt' namespaces will be removed. The 'XslCompiledTransform' class will use 'XslTransform'. The async calls won't be supported.
2. The `get_Current` method of the `IEnumerable` class and its inheritors will return a value by reference instead of returning by value when a collection stores reference types or strings. It is advisable everywhere when impossible to use C++ iterators (such as iterating over IList or any other interface). Using references instead of copying gives a good performance profit (up to 4x times faster).
3. The performance of methods of the classes that belong to 'System::IO' will be improved. Methods of 'Stream', 'TextWriter', and their inheritors classes will accept arguments by const reference instead of copying pointers. Possibly, the C#-code of a class-inheritor method is needs to be changed when the passed argument is changed inside it.
4. The new `IEnumerable`-level iterators and iterators for collections with duck typing will be added. The virtual native STL iterators are used where it is possible. New iterators are copiable, have full list of operators, work faster, and allow changing a container's element. But not all implementations provide all operators. E.g. the features of a one-direction iterator are available when `Enumerator` is used. An iterator dereferencement return type will be changed to reference.
