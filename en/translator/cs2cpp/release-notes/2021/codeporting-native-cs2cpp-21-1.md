## Major Features ##

1. The porter now generates the STL-style iteration methods (begin, end, cbegin, and so on) for ported classes, which implement the generic IEnumerable interface. To control this behavior, use the generate_begin_end_methods porter option.
1. The number of includes generated by the porter is decreased. Forward declarations are now used where is possible.
1. The Is.LessThan, Is.GreaterThan and Is.Positive NUnit assertions are now supported by porter.
1. The 'ref' and 'out' parameters are now properly ported for delegates and events.

## Minor fixes ##

1. Compilation of increments and decrements on indexers was fixed.
1. The non-generic IEnumerator is now properly working with the IterateOver syntax.
1. In the ported code, friend declarations can now be excluded from the Doxygen analysis. The new hide_friend_declarations option controls this behavior.
1. The new 'CppMakeMembersPublic' attribute was added. Using this attribute, the porter will make all type's entities public.
