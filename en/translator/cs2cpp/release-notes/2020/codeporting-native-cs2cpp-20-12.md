## Major Features ##

1. Porter is now capable of porting several classes overloaded by generic parameter count. These go into partial specialization of variadic template.
1. Porter can now report an error if an in-config attribute does not apply to any item during the project porting. To make it do so, use 'error_if_unused' syntax as describedÂ [at 'Attributes in configuration file' page](https://docs.codeporting.com/native/cs2cpp/developer-guide/codeporting-native-cs2cpp-configuration-file/attributes-in-configuration-file/).
1. UDP sockets now handle timeouts properly. The implementation now uses async calls.
1. The porter is now capable of porting 'Assert.That(expr, Throws.TypeOf<exc>)' and 'Assert.That(expr, Is.Empty)' Nunit checks.
1. A new 'enable_fast_rtti' [porter option](https://docs.codeporting.com/native/cs2cpp/developer-guide/codeporting-native-cs2cpp-configuration-file/configuration-file-options/#Henable_fast_rtti) was added making it possible to speed up casting operations (translations of c-style cast, 'as' and 'is' operators).

## Minor fixes ##

1. A new 'unexpected_override_as_warning' [porter option](https://docs.codeporting.com/native/cs2cpp/developer-guide/codeporting-native-cs2cpp-configuration-file/configuration-file-options/#Hunexpected_override_as_warning) was added making it possible to switch 'override is unexpected' message from error to warning.
1. LinkedList container was completely rewritten. It no longer leaks the memory.
1. RefCount class doesn't produce assertion fault if the counter goes beyond zero.
1. Some previously missing types were added into porter's typemap.
1. Graphics::MeasureString now wokrs properly with the characters that are absent from the font being used and loaded from fallback one instead.
1. Some cases of line cap drawing were fixed.
1. Incorrect paths in cmake target files for Visual Studio projects were fixed.
1. The performance of some Dictionary operations was improved.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes ##

1. CppIgnoreBaseType [attribute](https://docs.codeporting.com/native/cs2cpp/developer-guide/codeporting-native-cs2cpp-attributes/#HCppIgnoreBaseType) no longer can ignore System.Object inheritance implicitly. Explicit ignore still works.
