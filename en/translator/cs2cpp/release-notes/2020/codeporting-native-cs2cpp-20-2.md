## Major Features ##

1. A big part of HTTP and SOAP stacks support was added to the library.
1. Porter now uses semantic reordering when translating C# files containing multiple classes to have resulting C++ code compilable.
1. X509Certificate, X509Certificate2, RSA, DSA and related Cryptography classes were improved to match .Net behavior. ECDSA support was added.
1. ['CppUseReflection' porter attribute](https://docs.codeporting.com/native/cs2cpp/developer-guide/codeporting-native-cs2cpp-attributes/#HCppUseReflection) was supported. It is now possible to generate reflection information for the ported classes.

## Minor fixes ##

1. Porter was fixed to convert deep (over 100 items) nesting of 'if-else' constructs into compilable syntax.
1. Handling of multilevel 'if' config node was fixed in porter.
1. Porter was fixed to generate proper 'using' directives when translating partial classes.
1. LINQ methods in IEnumerable interface implementations were prefixed with 'LINQ_' string. It allows avoiding problems when using commonly used method names (e. g. ToArray or ToList) in classes that implement IEnumerable.
1. An option was added to XmlReaderSettings and related classes allowing it to disable character reference checks.
1. ISO8859 charsets support was fixed in Xml subsystem on Linux.
1. 'allowed_heap_only_types.config' file generated by porter is now sorted.
1. The translation of '+#' operator for delegates was fixed for some cases.
1. Current culture detection was fixed for some combinations of locale, system language, and interface language.
