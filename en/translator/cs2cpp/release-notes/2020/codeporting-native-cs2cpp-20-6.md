## Major Features ##

1. The graphic subsystem was reworked significantly. Many rendering bugs were fixed. Image manipulation results are now closer to such in .Net.
1. The Skia version used was updated.
1. More LINQ methods were supported in ported code. This includes Select, OfType, Cast, Contains, Last, LastOrDefault. FirstOrDefault and First methods were fixed.

## Minor fixes ##

1. Boundry checks for System::String::SubString() are now consistent with .Net behavior.
1. Streams and enumerable objects comparison in ported tests is now being done the same way as in NUnit.
1. Retrieval of 64-bit long file sizes was fixed.
1. System::String::LastIndexOf() now supports invariant culture.
1. Exceptions being thrown by the methods of System::String is now consistent with such in .Net.
1. Signatures of System::String::StartsWith() and System::String::EndsWith() methods were put in line with .Net implementations.
1. Performance of System::IO::Path::HasInvalidChars() method was slightly improved.
1. Porter was fixed to work properly with command-line arguments with spaces in them.
1. 'for_each_member_short_names' option was supported by porter. By default, porter now generates for_each_member-related information with long names instead of short ones.
1. has_operator_equal predicate was fixed to compile OK with GCC.
1. LittleCMS dependency was dropped.
1. The translation of the 'string + Nullable' operator was fixed.
1. A potential unreported error issue with XmlTextReader was fixed.
1. Behavior of CompareInfo::Compare(const String& a, const String& b, CompareOptions options) was fixed for some combinations of parameters.
1. Some improvements were made to Doxygen comments.
1. 'Unbox to nullable' behavior was fixed to behave in line with .Net implementation.
1. Assertion ported code for fixed for some cases involving nullable types and/or enums.
1. References to arithmetic types were fixed in Doxygen documentation produced by the porter.
1. XmlTextWriter no longer produces an error if the underlying stream was disposed of.
1. Equals() call was fixed for Nullable types.
1. Porter now processes documentation for public fields.
1. The behavior of the 'nunit_categories' configuration file node was extended, making it possible to include all categories that are not excluded explicitly.
1. 'emit' method of MulticastDelegate class was renamed to 'invoke' to avoid issues when compiling the code in the Qt environment.
1. A compiler warning was fixed coming from System::List's IndexOf(T, int) method.
1. Documentation for System::Boolean type was fixed.
1. Func class is now capable of holding null-reference.
