## Major Features ##

1. CodePorting.Native.Cs2Cpp.PortingControl Nuget package was released containing definitions of attributes recognized by the porter.
1. [CppNonConstMethod](https://docs.codeporting.com/native/cs2cpp/developer-guide/codeporting-native-cs2cpp-attributes/#HCppConstMethod), [CppConstWrapper](https://docs.codeporting.com/native/cs2cpp/developer-guide/codeporting-native-cs2cpp-attributes/#HCppConstWrapper), and [CppOverride](https://docs.codeporting.com/native/cs2cpp/developer-guide/codeporting-native-cs2cpp-attributes/#HCppConstMethod) attributes were supported by the porter.
1. VS2019 support was improved and added to the GUI application.
1. Increment and decrement operators are now properly ported for enums.
1. MulticastDelegate constructor was improved to avoid ambiguity in ported code for e. g. "string vs delegate" overloads.

## Minor fixes ##

1. The bug was fixed within SharedPtr class-leading to issues assigning weak pointers to shared ones.
1. XMLNS generation in XmlTextWriter class was made closer to .Net Framework behavior.
1. operator + was fixed for 'String + null object' case.
1. Native's visualizers were improved significantly.
1. db_data_reader.h compilation issues were fixed.
1. GraphicsPath::AddArc() was fixed for some cases.
1. Graphics::DrawString() was improved to use alignment properties.
1. XmlTextReader was fixed to use XmlNamespaceManager property.
1. Some memory management bugs were fixed for XmlTextReader class.
1. EnumValues::GetValueOf() was fixed for the case of integer values.
1. Issue disconnecting MulticastDelegate was fixed.
1. Some pointer implementations were removed from public headers.
1. Signatures of some Array methods were improved by adding 'const' qualifiers to their arguments.
1. Exception-to-object and object-to-exception casts were fixed in ported code.
1. Compilation errors invoking ValueType's methods from ported structs were fixed.
1. Assignment to variables of 'System::Type' type was fixed in ported code.
1. The Const getter deduction algorithm was improved in porter.
1. Missing includes when translating delegates were fixed.
1. Culture/locale fallback mechanism was added.
1. IEnumerator now inherits IDisposable, same as in .Net.
1. Enum::GetUnderlyingType() was supported.
1. System::Collections::List<bool>::ToArray() method was fixed.
1. A crash was fixed when unloading Aspose C++ products dynamically.
1. X509 certificates support was improved. Exception handling was put in line with .Net behavior. Private keys support was extended.
