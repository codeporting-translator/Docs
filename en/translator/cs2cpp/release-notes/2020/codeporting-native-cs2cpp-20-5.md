## Major Features ##

1. System::Xml namespace implementation was improved and extended. This includes implementing previously unsupported types and methods and establishing the basis for document signature support.
1. Issues with Aspose products' embedded resources were fixed.

## Minor fixes ##

1. Doxygen used to build project documentation was upgraded to 1.8.18 version. Some Doxygen warnings were fixed in header files.
1. Natives' visualizers supplied for our proprietary types were improved.
1. 'Nullptr to Nullable<T>' cast was fixed.
1. Translation of Assert.Throws() was fixed. False positives are no longer generated if no exception is being thrown.
1. XslCompiledTransform::Transform(const SharedPtr<XmlReader>& input, const SharedPtr<XmlWriter>& results) was implemented.
1. 'Where' LINQ extension method was supported by the porter.
1. GetType() was fixed for boxed enums.
1. File::ReadAllText() now detects UTF-8 encoding automatically.
1. A bug was fixed in porter placing output files above the project root if corresponding input files are placed above project root.
1. 'ASPOSE_CONST' legacy qualifier was removed by replacing it with a normal 'const' qualifier. Porter is no longer capable of generating it.
1. [CppConstWrapper](https://docs.codeporting.com/native/cs2cpp/developer-guide/codeporting-native-cs2cpp-attributes/#HCppConstWrapper) attribute no longer requires [CppNoConstMethod ](https://docs.codeporting.com/native/cs2cpp/developer-guide/codeporting-native-cs2cpp-attributes/#HCppConstMethod-1)one to be placed to the same method, as the same behavior is now supported implicitly.
1. Failures when loading inconsistent XML via XmlDocument::Load was fixed.
1. Empty comments skipping was fixed in porter.
1. The emplaced resource is no longer visible to other builds when the emplace_assembly_details option is enabled.
1. String::Substring() method now performs correct boundary checks the same way .Net does.
1. Assert.AreEqual() translation was extended to match the NUnit behavior when comparing streams (streams' contents get compared instead of pointers).
1. 64-bit long file sizes are now extracted properly.
1. Invariant cutlure is now supported by String::LastIndexOf().
1. DateTime::Parse() now throws same exceptions .Net does.
1. Relative paths are now generated for embedded resources instead of absolute ones.
1. Reflection support was improved.
1. GCC compilation issues withÂ has_operator_equal template were fixed.
